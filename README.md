# Event-SNN-Resources

## Code and Examples

The repository provides a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of various techniques and methods related to Event-based Spiking Neural Networks. Below are links to the key notebooks and their descriptions:

### Basic Examples

- [Basic Event Processing](https://github.com/radlab-sketch/Event-SNN-Resources/blob/main/Basic_Spiking_Example.ipynb): This notebook covers the fundamental steps for processing event-based data.

### Advanced Examples
- [Build Feedforward-SNN](https://github.com/radlab-sketch/Event-SNN-Resources/blob/main/FFSNN_Tutorial.ipynb): A tutorial on building Feed-Forward Spiking Neural Networks using PyTorch.
- [Build S-CNN](https://github.com/radlab-sketch/Event-SNN-Resources/blob/main/SCSNN_Tutorial.ipynb): A tutorial on building Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks using PyTorch.
  
### Techniques and Methods
- [Image to Poisson Spikes](https://github.com/mervess/images-to-spikes): This repository includes code to convert images into Poisson spikes.
- [Image to TTFS Spikes](https://github.com/NEvision/NE15/blob/master/focal/focal.py): Instructions and code to convert images into Time-to-First-Spikes activations.


### Datasets

The repository utilizes a variety of datasets. Besides classic RGB datasets, event-based datasets are provided by [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library for event-based data, which simplifies the handling and processing of event-based datasets. Below are some of the event datasets provided by Tonic:

- [N-MNIST](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist)
- [N-CALTECH101](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-caltech101)
- [CIFAR10-DVS](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00309/full)
- [IBM DVS Gestures](https://research.ibm.com/interactive/dvsgesture)
- [POKER-DVS](http://www2.imse-cnm.csic.es/caviar/POKERDVS.html)
